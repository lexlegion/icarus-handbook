## The situation for a legionnaire
You are someone that sees injustice or any other bad situation where normal means has not been working… Any situation of discrimination, silencing or fringe work applies - be it sexism, racism, trip reports, work place bullying or way, way worse - the legion will listen!

The normal means of emailing and calling has not been fruitful for your cause and you feel there is still justice to be skipped, or at the very least you have a story that needs to get out...

* It's your voice!
* It's your face!
* It's your life!
* It's your wink!
* It's your video!

And they're all YOUR story!

## Purpose and shape of a story
The purpose of the story is of course to shine a light on a problem you have, and in the story this will of course be stated clearly. In the story the legionnaire face will also be clearly visible during the entirety of the recording and the audio should be of such quality that the legionnaire's voice is easy to pick up. Also, since it is your story it is of course so that each story only contains one legionnaire!

Also, do not forget to state the time and date, source and also the targeted individual or organisation properly, and so on! Please see the protocol (currently in draft) for further details.
If an individual is targeted only the persons name and your relation (ie. “This is for John Doe, my boss at CompanyX”) will be enough, the idea of the story and the legion is to force a reaction of the counterpart, not to have the whole globe be able to phone or email spam a certain individual. If others want to join in to the same cause, they are free to record a story of their own or contact the legionnaire and ask how they otherwise can help.

## Purpose of multiple links
By uploading the same story to multiple services (Youtube, Vimeo, etc) you make sure there is more than one source hosting your voice - if one service thinks your story is too dangerous for contemporary society or dangerous for the host itself (countersued by the targeted organisation, too visceral a trip report or other some such scenarios), you still have other places to let your voice be heard through.
Same goes with the links, <em>all</em> services where the legionnaire has an account (Instagram, Twitter, etc) should be used to host a thread to <em>all</em> copies of the legionnaire's story.

This way a legionnaire creates a weave of an unstoppable nature, and only the legionnaire self can decide to remove it.

Not only that, but any video hosting service that decides to remove the legionnaires story will automatically get smudged since that specific thread will not work.
In the main story thread the legionnaire should then link to the forum (or somesuch) where the main discussion will be held and when the legionnaire is content with the situation, they can mark it simply as resolved by stating so in the main thread and also in the separate threads if possible. Only the original legionnaire has the power to state the situation solved and only the legionnaire will decide if the weaved cape will be removed or be left as proof for others to be seen.

## Purpose of the legion
The legion is the voice and will of the people, and it shapes the future of the planet - one weaved story at the time. If it’s not anti-patriarchal in nature, it is at least very ex-patriarchal (as in “outside looking in”).

It's come to these dire straits, the secret handshake is a wink! ";)" (Behind the masks we will find us!)

Together we will weave an unstoppable, non-deletable, well voiced world wide unionizing!

Please use the angels supplied by Yesod for the physical tagging, or create your own to tell others that you are shining some light on a special situation!

## Misc
For trip reports, please refer to the protocol. (currently in draft)

## We are legion!
All hail the will of the people!
## We are many!
